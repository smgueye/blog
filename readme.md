# Seydina Mouhamed Gueye

The purpose of this blog is take notes about my progress.
My main goal is to understand and master fundamentals algorithms need for 
day to day problem solving ability, and to tie my craft in mathematics.
During my journey, i will try to explain the why and when to apply concept.

There is a proverb in French that says: "Lorsqu'on ne sait pas ou l'on va, on retourne d'ou l'on vient."
I'm going back to mathematics to have better understand of software systems and to be a better problem solver.

The main goal of this blog is also to tie my craft at writting and improve my communication.

I find the majority of blog post content not well organised, even filter by tag does not guide the lecturer on either 
where should he start or the prerequises to read to understand  
I will try my best to keep informations in this blog well organised
